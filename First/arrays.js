// Array
// collection of values of different data types
// to create an array we use square brackets and separate each value with a comma
// to access a value in an array we use the index number of the value we want to access in the array and use square brackets ex: array[index number]
// Index starts at 0
// in the example below we are removing the last value from the array
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
colors.pop();
// to add a value to an array we use the push method and pass in the value we want to add to the array
colors.push("yellow");
// to remove a value from an array we use the pop method and pass in the number of values we want to remove from the array
colors.pop();
// to remove a value from an array we use the shift method and pass in the number of values we want to remove from the array
colors.shift();
let cars = ["Ford", "BMW", "Honda"];
//length property
// to find the length of an array we use the length property and pass in the array we want to find the length of
cars.length;
